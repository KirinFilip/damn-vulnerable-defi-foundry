The contract has a `flashLoan()` function that only takes the amount, checks if the pool has enough and does not check for anything else. It then sends the money to `msg.sender` through an interface that has a function `execute()` which can be exploited. The `flashLoan()` function also uses a guard with the contract's balance which is always bad to do. We will create an attack contract that calls `flashLoan()` with the full amount of the pool's balance. We will use the interface to create our own `execute()` function which will call pool’s `deposit()` function with the `msg.value` we got from the pool. Then lastly we will call the pool’s `withdraw()` function and then send the value we got to the attacker address via the `transfer()` function.
