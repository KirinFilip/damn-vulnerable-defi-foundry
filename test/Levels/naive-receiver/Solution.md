The `FlashLoanReceiver` contract has a function `receiveEther()`, which must be called by the pool. The function takes whatever amount it gets from `msg.value` and adds the `fee` amount that it receives by the pool, and stores those amounts in a variable `amountToBeRepaid`. In the last line of the function it returns the `amountToBeRepaid` to the pool. The problem is really on both `FlashLoanReceiver` and `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` contracts. `NaiveReceiverLenderPool` has a problem in the `flashLoan()` function. It can be called by anyone with any amount to borrow. There is no check for the `borrowAmount` variable. `FlashLoanReceiver` has a problem in the `receiveEther()` function. It sends back the `amountToBeRepaid = msg.value + fee` without checking what the `msg.value` even is. So if the `msg.value` is `0`, which is possible since the `flashLoan()` function does not check it, the `receiveEther()` function will just return the fee amount to the pool.
