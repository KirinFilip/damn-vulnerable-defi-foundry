`SelfiePool` is a flash loan contract with governance. `SimpleGovernance` is a governance contract that can be abused with a flash loan, since it accepts majority token holder decisions and uses a token with snapshot abilities. We can take a flash loan, deposit the flash loan to the governance contract making the attacker a governance token majority holder, and take a snapshot of that. Then we can use that power to queue a governance action to drain all funds within the `SelfiePool` flash loan contract. Lastly after waiting out the action delay of 2 days we call `executeAction` and drain all the funds.
